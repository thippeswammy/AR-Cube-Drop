# Unity ARFoundation Cube Placement

This Unity project demonstrates an AR application built using ARFoundation. The app allows users to place cubes of random colors at tapped screen locations and captures an image of the AR scene 10 frames after the cube is placed.

## Features
- **Cube Placement:** Tapping the screen places a cube of random color at a location 2 meters in front of the camera.
- **Image Capture:** Captures an image from the AR camera 10 frames after a cube is placed.
- **Platform Support:** The application runs on Android, iOS, or a compatible emulator.

## How It Works
1. Tap the screen to place a randomly colored cube.
2. The cube appears 2 meters in front of the AR camera.
3. An image of the AR scene is captured 10 frames after the cube is placed and saved to the device.
